# Substring Search

# Task: Given the string s, use string methods to:
# - Find the index of "fox": get the starting index of the substring "fox". If "fox" is not found, it should return -1.
# - Count occurrences of "the": Use the string's built-in method to count how many times the substring "the" appears in the string.


text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
inde = text.find("fox")
print(f"index of 'fox' is {inde}")

count = text.count("the")
print(f" 'the' appears  {count} times in the string")
